    <p>
        I'm Dayana Daviott, a nature-loving adventurer with a passion for yoga, climbing, and hiking in the mountains.The experience of immersing myself in new cultures, learning different languages, and navigating unfamiliar landscapes has shaped me into a highly adaptable and open-mind individual.

<p>
    Although I graduated in Tourism Business Administration, my real passion lies in web development. I have chosen to pursue a career in web development at SheCodes.com. This decision reflects my thirst for knowledge and personal growth. By combining my expertise in the tourism industry with my programming skills, I aim to create innovative solutions that enhance user experiences and push the boundaries of what's possible.
</p>
</br>
<p>
    In summary, I'm an adventurous spirit who finds joy in the great outdoors and has chosen web development as a path to combine my passions and create meaningful change. With a deep appreciation for nature, a multicultural perspective, and a love for coding, I'm excited to embark on a journey of exploration and growth in the world of web development.
